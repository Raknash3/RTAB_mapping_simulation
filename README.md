# Description:

This repository showcases the implementation of RTAB-SLAM for accurate environment mapping using two Intel RealSense R200 cameras on the TurtleBot3 simulated in Gazebo. Navigate through our launch files to simulate the world, start RTAB mapping, and control the robot. Please note that real-time performance might be impacted due to memory limitations in VMware. Kindly be aware that certain workspace details are excluded due to NDA constraints, but we've included insightful launch file descriptions for your reference.

# Description of launch file
- world.launch: Will launch the world in gaebo with the trutlebot3
- mapping2.launch: Will start RTAB mapping and open RTAB viewer
- teleop.launch: For controlling the robot
